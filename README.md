## 🔧 Usage

### Option 1: Interactive Dashboard (Recommended)

1. **Start the Streamlit app**
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

2. **Navigate through the tabs**:
   - **Data Overview**: View data quality and summary statistics
   - **Model Training**: Train ROAS forecasting models
   - **Predictions**: View ROAS predictions with confidence intervals
   - **Recommendations**: Get actionable campaign recommendations

### Option 2: Jupyter Notebook

1. **Open the notebook**
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/phase1_roas_forecasting.ipynb
```

2. **Run all cells** to see the complete analysis pipeline

### Option 3: Programmatic Usage

```python
from src.utils.data_loader import GameLensDataLoader
from src.utils.feature_engineering import GameLensFeatureEngineer
from src.utils.roas_forecaster import GameLensROASForecaster

# Load data
data_loader = GameLensDataLoader()
platform_data = data_loader.load_all_data()
combined_data = data_loader.combine_platforms(platform_data)

# Create features
feature_engineer = GameLensFeatureEngineer()
features_df = feature_engineer.create_cohort_features(combined_data)
X, y = feature_engineer.prepare_training_data(features_df, target_day=30)

# Train model
forecaster = GameLensROASForecaster(target_day=30)
models = forecaster.train_model(X, y)

# Make predictions
predictions = forecaster.predict_with_confidence(X)

# Generate recommendations
recommendations = forecaster.generate_recommendations(X, y, target_roas=1.0)
```

## 📊 Data Requirements

### Expected CSV Files

The system expects the following CSV files in your Unity Ads data directory:

#### Android (`Campaign Data/Unity Ads/Android/`)
- `Adspend and Revenue data.csv` - Daily spend and revenue data
- `Level Progression.csv` - Level completion events
- `retention.csv` - Retention rates by day
- `ROAS data.csv` - ROAS metrics by day

#### iOS (`Campaign Data/Unity Ads/iOS/`)
- `Adspend+ Revenue .csv` - Daily spend and revenue data
- `Level Progression.csv` - Level completion events
- `retention.csv` - Retention rates by day
- `ROAS.csv` - ROAS metrics by day

### Data Schema

#### Adspend & Revenue Data
```csv
country,day,installs,cost,ad_revenue,revenue
United States,2025-08-01,15,8.8053,2.4321,3.949
```

## 🎯 Model Performance

### Key Metrics
- **MAPE**: Mean Absolute Percentage Error
- **RMSE**: Root Mean Square Error
- **R²**: Coefficient of determination
- **Confidence Coverage**: Percentage of actual values within prediction intervals

### Expected Performance
Based on the sample data, the model typically achieves:
- **MAPE**: 15-25% for D30 ROAS prediction
- **Confidence Coverage**: 80-90% of actual values within intervals
- **Feature Importance**: Early retention and ROAS metrics are most predictive

## 💡 Recommendations System

The system generates six types of recommendations:

1. **Scale Aggressively**: High potential campaigns (ROAS gap > 20%)
2. **Scale Moderately**: Good potential campaigns (ROAS gap 10-20%)
3. **Scale Cautiously**: Marginal potential campaigns (ROAS gap 0-10%)
4. **Maintain Current Spend**: On-target campaigns (ROAS gap -10% to 0%)
5. **Reduce Spend**: Underperforming campaigns (ROAS gap -20% to -10%)
6. **Cut Spend**: Poor performing campaigns (ROAS gap < -20%)

## 🔮 Phase 2 Roadmap

### Planned Enhancements
- **Automated Data Ingestion**: API connections to MMPs and ad networks
- **Daily Pipeline**: Automated ETL and model retraining
- **Alerts System**: "Traffic Cop" alerts for KPI changes
- **Multi-Day Models**: D15, D45, D90 ROAS prediction
- **Scenario Simulator**: What-if analysis for different strategies
- **Web Dashboard**: Full SaaS product with user management

### Technical Improvements
